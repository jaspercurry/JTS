"""Unit tests for jasper-aec-bridge stall-recovery.

The bridge's mic input is a PortAudio `InputStream` that is opened
once at startup and runs until process exit. When the underlying
ALSA capture PCM enters an unrecoverable state (typically a USB
underrun on the XVF chip's UAC2 capture endpoint), PortAudio
silently stops invoking the registered callback — no exception,
no error code, no recovery hook. The bridge sits there, draining
nothing onto its mic queue.

Without stall detection, `_aec_loop` would log a per-second
warning forever, never freeing LoopbackAEC to fresh audio, and
the wake-word detector reading hw:7,1 would stay deaf. This was
hit in production on 2026-05-11: ~10 minutes of silent failure,
"Hey Jarvis" got no response, no audible cue.

These tests pin the contract:
  - Threshold breach → `BridgeStalled` raised → process exits 1
    → systemd `Restart=on-failure` revives with a fresh stream.
  - Successful frame resets the counter (so a brief 1-2 s ALSA
    stutter doesn't flap the daemon).
