"""Tests for the room-correction wizard at /correction/.

The page started as the Phase 0 mic-permission skeleton and has grown
into the full correction wizard, so this file pins both browser-facing
HTML/JS contracts and real HTTP dispatch:

  1. Page render — hostname substitutes through, sample-rate constant
     reaches the JS, the WiiM-style placement advice is present, the
     CA-download link is present.
  2. Healthz returns plain-text "ok" so systemd / curl probes work.
  3. End-to-end via a real ThreadingHTTPServer to confirm the routes
     dispatch from real HTTP — same shape as test_voice_setup.

Keep the existing test names where possible so future-me can grep for
the original Phase 0 pins.
