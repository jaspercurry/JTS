"""Pytest configuration.

Three pieces here, all load-bearing:

- A Python version guard (module-level) that fires before any collection
  so a wrong-version venv errors with a clear fix message instead of a
  TypeError deep in jasper/peering/ (which uses 3.10+ dataclass slots=).

- A module-level `socketserver` shutdown-latency shim (see below), which
  has to run before any fixture starts a throwaway HTTP server.

- An autouse os.environ snapshot/restore fixture so any test (or any
  production code under test) that writes to os.environ directly gets
  cleaned up at teardown. pytest's monkeypatch only rolls back changes
  *it* made via setenv/delenv; direct os.environ[...] = ... mutations
  (e.g. by jasper.env_load.load_env_files, which is what production
  ships) silently leak across tests. The leak's most-visible victim
  was tests/voice_eval/ running with OPENAI_API_KEY=wiz-key dragged in
  from a test_doctor case — see #254 / #255 / #256 for context (this
  fixture, which contains that leak, landed in #256).

# --- socketserver shutdown latency -------------------------------------
#
# 23 test files spin a throwaway ThreadingHTTPServer per test (51 call
# sites) to exercise the wizard/control HTTP surfaces. socketserver's
# `shutdown()` blocks until the `serve_forever()` loop notices the
# shutdown flag, and that loop only checks it once per `poll_interval` —
# which defaults to 0.5 s. So every one of those tests paid up to half a
# second of pure teardown sleep.
#
# Measured on this machine, one start/request/shutdown cycle:
#   default (0.5 s poll) : 418 ms mean  (max 507 ms)
#   poll_interval=0.01   :   9 ms mean  (max  12 ms)
#
# tests/test_control_server.py alone has 220 tests and spent ~90 s almost
# entirely here; the 23 affected files were together ~23% of total suite
# runtime. Lowering the default is a pure latency win: poll_interval only
# controls how often the accept loop wakes to re-check the flag, so it
# changes no request handling, no ordering, and no isolation. Tests that
# want a different cadence still pass `poll_interval=` explicitly, which
# continues to win because this only rebinds the DEFAULT.
#
# Deliberately scoped to the test suite. Production keeps the lazy 0.5 s
# poll (jasper/web/*_setup.py, jasper/control/server.py): there the trade
# is idle wakeups on a 1 GB Pi against a shutdown latency nobody can
# observe, and the stdlib default is the right call. asyncio servers use a
# different `serve_forever()` with no poll_interval and are untouched.
