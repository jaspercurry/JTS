"""Citi Bike (NYC + Jersey City + Hoboken) GBFS client.

Two public-CDN feeds, no API key (https://gbfs.citibikenyc.com/gbfs/gbfs.json):

  * station_information.json  — id/name/lat/lon/capacity. 1 h TTL.
  * station_status.json       — bikes/ebikes/docks/last_reported. 30 s TTL.

A module-private TTL cache fronts both feeds. On a fresh-fetch failure
with any cached entry present (even past its TTL) we serve the cached
copy and the caller can disclose staleness via
`StationStatus.last_reported_age_seconds`. A transient GBFS outage
therefore degrades the answer rather than silencing it.

This module is the GBFS data layer; the wizard provider at
`jasper.transit.providers.citibike` imports `fetch_feed` to power
"nearest station" lookups, and the voice tool (PR 2) constructs a
`CitiBikeClient` from the wizard-written env vars for live queries.

Everything here is sync. The voice tool wraps `CitiBikeClient.get_status`
in `asyncio.to_thread` so the realtime LLM session never blocks —
matches the subway pattern in `jasper.subway` rather than bus's
parallel-fan-out AsyncClient (we only hit two feeds, both cached,
so async would be unnecessary complexity).

# the StationStatus dataclass field stay raw so they match what
