"""The household's remembered measurement microphone (Wave-2 persistence).

Before this module, nothing about the measurement mic persisted across
correction sessions:

* the phone relay's "setup" (mic model + serial/upload calibration) is
  validated against a ``setup_binding_id`` that is a per-run
  ``session_id``/``context_id`` (see ``_validated_relay_setup_binding`` and
  ``_run_relay_level_match`` in ``jasper/web/correction_setup.py``), minted
  fresh on every run, so a phone-side "remembered setup" can never validate
  against a NEW session's binding; and
* an uploaded calibration is stored via
  ``store_calibration(provider="manual_upload", serial=None)`` — with no
  serial, so the vendor-lookup cache (``find_stored_calibration``, keyed by
  ``serial_hash`` + model + orientation) can never reach it again.

Every session made the household re-select a mic model and re-supply the
calibration (re-type a serial or re-upload a file) from scratch.

This module owns exactly ONE durable JSON record —
``/var/lib/jasper/correction/household_mic.json`` — recording the mic/
calibration that most recently succeeded. It is written after every
SUCCESSFUL calibration establishment (a vendor fetch or an accepted upload)
or explicit re-confirmation of the current one (a phone one-tap "Using
{mic} — confirm"), from both the phone-relay flow (room + crossover share
``_relay_calibration_from_setup`` in ``jasper/web/correction_setup.py``,
whose ``mode="stored"`` branch is the re-confirm path) and the local/laptop
flow (``_handle_calibration_fetch`` / ``_handle_calibration_upload`` in the
same module). Downstream consumers — the capture-spec ``default_setup``
prefill hint (``jasper/capture_relay/spec.py``) and the room wizard's
server-rendered mic selection — read it so the household does not re-enter
what it already told JTS. A session that establishes a DIFFERENT mic is
never blocked; the new success simply replaces the record (see
``correction.household_mic_replaced`` in ``jasper/web/correction_setup.py``).

No secrets land in the record: ``serial_hash`` is the same one-way hash the
calibration record itself carries, and ``serial_display`` is at most the
raw serial's last 4 characters, purely for the UI. The full serial is never
persisted here (or anywhere else in the calibration registry — see
``jasper/audio_measurement/calibration.py``).

The phone page's one-tap "Using {label} · {serial_display} — one tap to
confirm" screen (``capture-page/js/main.js``'s ``renderCalibrationConfirm``,
2026-07 Wave-2 batch) reads the capture spec's ``default_setup`` field this
module feeds (``correction_setup.py``'s
``_default_setup_calibration_for_spec``) and — when the hint is marked
``resolvable: true`` — submits ``setup.calibration = {mode: "stored",
calibration_id}`` (plus ``model``, display-only) for the Pi to resolve via
``resolve_household_mic_calibration`` below, through the ``mode="stored"``
branch of ``_relay_calibration_from_setup``. ``resolvable`` is minted fresh
at spec-build time (a second, independent resolver call — not inferred from
the hint existing at all), so a household record whose calibration has gone
missing from disk since the last session still ships the OTHER hint fields
but without the marker, and an older Pi build (pre-``stored``-mode) never
mints it either; either way the page falls back to its plain full picker. A
rejection at submit time (the record went stale in the narrow window
between mint and tap) is not a dead end either — the page catches it and
re-offers the full picker with a plain sentence. An older capture page
ignores unknown spec fields (verified against
``capture-page/js/transport-integrity.js``), so shipping ``default_setup``
is safe against any deployed page in either direction.
