    """dB the emitted graph's BROADBAND level MOVED across one apply (#1811).

    Negative when the apply made the speaker quieter — the ordinary case, and
    the whole reason this exists: the applied correction's boost is absorbed as
    a pre-split common attenuation, so the same commanded volume produces a
    materially quieter speaker the instant the config swaps.

    **This is an input to ANALYSIS, never to the speaker's level.** The
    absorption keeps the boosted branch at or below unity (see
    ``camilla_yaml.program_headroom_db``). Compensating at main volume would
    undo that attenuation. The consumer is
    :func:`~jasper.active_speaker.delta_probe.classify_delta_probe`, whose
    realized-vs-commanded comparison is not mean-centered and would otherwise
    read this move as a defect.

    Read from the profiles, never assumed: the magnitude is whatever the fit
    charged (22.5 dB on the session that surfaced this; a few dB once the
    loudness-doctrine work shrinks the charge), and a correction that hands
    headroom BACK yields a positive number.

    **This is the pre-split term, and it is the ONLY level term the commanded
    axis cannot carry** (#2611). The absorption is applied BEFORE the branch
    split, so ``predicted_branch_sum`` — a model of the two branches — has no
    place to put it, which is why it travels as a scalar beside the commanded
    curve rather than inside it. Per-branch trims are excluded here for the
    complementary reason: since #2611 they ARE on the commanded axis, which is
    the applied graph's predicted sum minus the PREVIOUS graph's
    (:mod:`jasper.active_speaker.crossover_v2.commanded`), so counting them here
    too would remove them twice. Before that fix they were in neither account —
    both sides of the commanded delta carried the applied candidate's own
    trims, so a per-role gain step cancelled out of the model entirely and
    landed in ``residual_offset_db`` as a surprise (+3.2198 dB on the
    2026-08-16 jts3 round). The two accounts are disjoint and, between them,
    complete for everything the apply commands.

    **One known incompleteness, deliberate, caught downstream.**
    Room-PEQ and preference-EQ headroom are excluded. The candidate's own room
    set is emitted, including its boost headroom, and the preference layer is not
    emitted at all; neither term is read here, so a round that changes either
    can see a real level move this reader cannot see. That remainder is
    exactly what the probe's ``residual_offset_db`` measures and what
    ``delta_probe.VERDICT_LEVEL_MISMATCH`` names — which is why this function
    is allowed to be an honest partial account rather than having to be a
    complete one.

    **The defect this exists for.** On 2026-08-15 (jts3 cycle 4) the applied
    record still named run 2's candidate while the speaker had been reconciled
    out of band to ``sound_current.yml``. Nothing compared the two, so a restore
    faithfully put back "the previous sound" per the record — a graph the
